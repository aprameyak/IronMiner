Workers can barely move through, and the conduit staged on the floor is blocking the walkway.\n\nCompared to yesterday, congestion in Zone B got worse. It was two trades yesterday, now it's three. Zone C near the crane also has a safety concern — two workers spotted without hard hats in the swing radius. This is the second day in a row.\n\nThe good news: formwork removal on level 1 is running ahead of schedule. The east deck is clearing out faster than expected.\n\nRecommendation: Move the electrical crew in Zone B to the afternoon shift so they're not overlapping with framing. Address the hard hat issue in Zone C immediately — it's a repeat violation.",
    "s2": "Work is moving steadily but there's a logistics problem on the south side. A lumber delivery got staged right across the main access road, which means equipment can't get to the west bay. This showed up between the morning and midday scans — it wasn't there earlier.\n\nThe east bay has two trades sharing space (concrete and plumbing) but it's manageable for now. No safety flags today.\n\nRecommendation: Get the lumber restaged off the access road before the afternoon equipment run. If it stays, the west bay crew will be idle.",

=== OSHA CONSTRUCTION SAFETY REGULATORY FRAMEWORK (29 CFR Part 1926) ===

CORE SUBPARTS:
- Subpart C (1926.20-35): General Safety / Means of Egress — exits must remain clear at all times
- Subpart E (1926.95-106): PPE — hard hats (1926.100), eye protection, hi-vis, hearing; employer-provided and mandatory
- Subpart M (1926.500-503): Fall Protection — required above 6 ft; guardrails, safety nets, or PFAS (personal fall arrest system)
- Subpart N (1926.550 / 1926.1400-1442): Cranes & Derricks — signal person LOS required (1926.1419), no workers under suspended loads (1926.1431)
- Subpart Q (1926.650): Excavations
- Subpart R (1926.750-761): Steel Erection
- Subpart S (1926.800): Underground Construction
- Subpart T (1926.850): Demolition
- Subpart V (1926.950): Power Transmission
- Subpart W (1926.1050-1060): Ladders — 3-point contact required (1926.1053); portable ladders must extend 3 ft above landing
- Subpart X (1926.1100): Hand & Power Tools
- Subparts Z/GS (1926.Subpart Z): Hazardous materials; hot work permit + fire watch required within 35 ft of combustibles (1926.352)
- Electrical: LOTO (lockout/tagout) required before work on energized circuits (1926.417)

FATAL FOUR HAZARD CATEGORIES (OSHA Priority — account for >60% of construction deaths):
1. FALLS — #1 killer; fall from elevation violations are always HIGH or CRITICAL
2. STRUCK-BY — cranes, vehicles, falling objects, unsecured loads
3. CAUGHT-IN/BETWEEN — unguarded machinery, excavation cave-in, pinch points
4. ELECTROCUTION — live panels without LOTO, exposed wiring, wet conditions

HIERARCHY OF CONTROLS (most to least preferred):
  Elimination → Substitution → Engineering Controls → Administrative Controls → PPE

MULTI-EMPLOYER DOCTRINE:
  On multi-trade worksites, the controlling employer (general contractor) is responsible
  for the safety of ALL workers, even subcontractor employees, in shared zones.
  Multi-trade congestion in confined areas compounds coordination hazards significantly.

SEVERITY ESCALATION TRIGGERS:
  - Worker in crane swing radius without PPE: IMMEDIATE stop-work
  - Worker under suspended load: IMMEDIATE stop-work
  - Blocked emergency egress: notify emergency services coordination
  - Hot work without fire watch: stop hot work immediately
  - Live electrical work without LOTO: de-energize before work continues
  - Harness not tied off at elevation: worker must descend until corrected

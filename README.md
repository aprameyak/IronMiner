# IronSite Manager

Spatial intelligence platform for construction site management. AI agents analyze job site video footage to detect congestion, safety violations, and productivity bottlenecks — then deliver plain-English briefings to non-technical site managers.

## The Problem

Construction sites lose productivity when multiple trades compete for the same physical space. Current AI vision models can identify objects but fail at understanding spatial relationships — who's crowding whom, which zones are over-allocated, how patterns change over time.

## What This Does

Three AI agents work together:

1. **Video Agent** — Ingests site footage, extracts frames, runs spatial analysis via GPU processing (vest.ai)
2. **Safety Agent** — Analyzes for PPE compliance, zone adherence, blocked corridors
3. **Productivity Agent** — Scores congestion per zone, detects trade overlap, suggests resource reallocation

Results flow into a dashboard with two modes:
- **Review Mode** — Upload footage, get AI briefings, view zone congestion maps, browse alerts
- **Live Mode** — Monitor camera feeds in real-time, talk to workers, get instant alerts

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Frontend | React + Vite |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python) |
| AI | Claude API (vision + text) |
| GPU Processing | Vast.ai |
| Live Comms | WebSockets |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 (VastAI currently requires `distutils`, which is not available in 3.12+)
- Node.js 18+

### Setup

```bash
# Clone
git clone <repo-url> && cd ironminer

# Python environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend dependencies
cd gui && npm install && cd ..

# Environment variables (optional — mock data works without these)
cp .env.example .env
```

### Run

The easiest way — start both servers at once:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh
```

This launches:
- **Backend** at `http://localhost:8000` (Swagger docs at `/docs`)
- **Frontend** at `http://localhost:5173`

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop both.

Or run them separately:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd gui && npm run dev
```

The frontend proxies `/api` and `/ws` requests to the backend automatically (configured in `vite.config.js`), so no CORS issues in development.

### Without the Backend

The frontend works standalone — it falls back to built-in mock data and shows a yellow "DEMO DATA" badge. Useful for UI development without running the API.

## API Overview

All endpoints are at `/api/*`. Full details in the Swagger docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

| Group | Prefix | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Sites | `/api/sites` | Site CRUD, briefings, timelines |
| Video | `/api/video` | Upload footage, track processing jobs |
| Safety | `/api/safety` | Safety reports, violation lists |
| Productivity | `/api/productivity` | Congestion zones, trade overlaps, suggestions |
| Alerts | `/api/alerts` | Cross-site alert feed with acknowledgment |
| Streaming | `/api/streaming` | Camera feeds, live scanning, WebSocket endpoints |

## Contributing

Each agent is independent. Pick your area and implement:

- **Video Agent** → `app/agents/video_agent.py` + `app/routers/video.py`
- **Safety Agent** → `app/agents/safety_agent.py` + `app/routers/safety.py`
- **Productivity Agent** → `app/agents/productivity_agent.py` + `app/routers/productivity.py`
- **Frontend** → `gui/src/`

Agent stubs have TODO comments explaining what to build. Models in `app/models/` define the API contract — don't change the shapes without coordinating with the frontend.
